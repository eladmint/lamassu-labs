# Perplexity Research Prompt: Find Real Eliza Trading Agents

Please research and provide comprehensive information about **open-source Eliza trading agents** that we can clone and test with TrustWrapper integration. We need actual GitHub repositories with trading/crypto/DeFi agents built on the Eliza framework.

## Research Questions:

### 1. **Open Source Eliza Trading Agents**
- Find GitHub repositories of Eliza agents focused on:
  - Crypto trading (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
  - DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Aave, etc.)
  - Trading signals and analysis
  - Portfolio management
  - Yield farming strategies
- Provide direct GitHub links to repositories
- Note which ones are actively maintained (commits in last 3 months)
- Identify which have the most stars/forks (popularity indicators)

### 2. **Eliza Agent Examples & Templates**
- Find official Eliza framework examples that include:
  - Trading functionality
  - Financial advice features
  - Market analysis capabilities
  - Web3/blockchain integrations
- Look for character.json examples with trading personalities
- Find any tutorial repositories showing how to build trading agents

### 3. **Community Trading Agents**
- Search for Eliza agents mentioned in:
  - Eliza Discord server
  - Twitter/X (search "@elizaos trading agent")
  - Reddit communities (r/elizaos if exists)
  - Dev.to or Medium articles about Eliza trading bots
- Find developers who have built trading agents and shared their code

### 4. **Agent Marketplaces & Directories**
- Are there directories listing Eliza agents?
- Is there an official Eliza agent marketplace?
- Any community-maintained lists of agents?
- Agent sharing platforms or repositories?

### 5. **Integration Examples**
- Find examples of Eliza agents using plugins
- How do existing agents integrate third-party services?
- Examples of agents with custom actions for trading
- Any agents already doing risk management or verification?

### 6. **Technical Requirements**
For each agent found, note:
- Programming language (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Required API keys (OpenAI, exchanges, etc.)
- Dependencies and plugins used
- Deployment method (local, cloud, Docker)
- Configuration complexity

### 7. **Potential Test Candidates**
Identify 5-10 agents that would be ideal for testing because they:
- Are open source with clear licenses
- Have trading/financial functionality
- Are well-documented
- Have active maintainers
- Could benefit from hallucination prevention

### 8. **Contact Information**
For promising projects, find:
- GitHub usernames of maintainers
- Discord/Twitter handles if available
- Project documentation links
- Contribution guidelines

## Specific Search Queries to Use:

1. `site:github.com "eliza" "trading agent" "character.json"`
2. `site:github.com "elizaos" crypto bot`
3. `"@elizaos/core" trading intitle:"GitHub"`
4. `eliza framework "defi agent" opensource`
5. `"eliza agent" "trading strategies" repository`

## Output Format Needed:

Please provide:
1. **Direct GitHub repository links** (not just descriptions)
2. **Brief description** of what each agent does
3. **Last commit date** to gauge activity
4. **Stars/forks count** for popularity
5. **Key features** related to trading
6. **Setup complexity** (easy/medium/hard)
7. **Contact info** for maintainers if available

## Why This Research Matters:

We're building TrustWrapper, a plugin that prevents AI trading agents from giving dangerous hallucinated advice (like recommending scam tokens or impossible returns). To prove it works, we need to:
1. Clone real trading agents
2. Integrate TrustWrapper
3. Test that it catches hallucinations
4. Show it doesn't block legitimate trades

This research will identify the best open-source candidates for our testing.

**Note**: Focus on finding actual code repositories we can clone and modify, not just descriptions or closed-source services.

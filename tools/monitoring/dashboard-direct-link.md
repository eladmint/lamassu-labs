# TrustWrapper Monitoring Dashboard - Direct Links

Due to browser caching issues, use these direct links to access the dashboard:

## Primary Dashboard URL (with cache bypass):
https://cmhvu-6iaaa-aaaal-asg5q-cai.icp0.io/monitor.html

## Alternative URLs (if cache persists):
- https://cmhvu-6iaaa-aaaal-asg5q-cai.icp0.io/monitor.html?v=2
- https://cmhvu-6iaaa-aaaal-asg5q-cai.icp0.io/monitor.html?refresh=true
- https://cmhvu-6iaaa-aaaal-asg5q-cai.icp0.io/index.html (redirects to monitor.html)

## To Force Refresh:
1. Visit the monitor.html URL directly
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) to hard refresh
3. Or open in an incognito/private browser window

## Dashboard Shows:
- **12 Total Transactions** (5 + 3 + 4)
- **3 Healthy Contracts** (All Active)
- **100% Success Rate**
- **No Connection Dependencies** (Pure static display)

The dashboard now uses a completely static HTML file with no JavaScript API calls that could fail or reset the data to zero.

open monitoring/ziggurat-dashboard-viewer.html
```
This provides a beautiful interface to interact with your deployed dashboard.

### **2. Direct Dashboard**
```bash
open monitoring/dashboard-juno.html
```
Direct access to the monitoring dashboard with ICP integration.

### **3. ICP Endpoints**
- **Primary**: https://bvxuo-uaaaa-aaaal-asgua-cai.icp0.io
- **Raw**: https://bvxuo-uaaaa-aaaal-asgua-cai.raw.icp0.io

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Why Ziggurat Satellite Works**
You were absolutely right to ask about using the Ziggurat satellite! Here's why it worked:

1. **Custom ICP Client**: The Ziggurat satellite has a custom data storage API via `ICPClient`
2. **Blockchain Storage**: Data is stored directly on the ICP blockchain with cryptographic proofs
3. **Decentralized Access**: No central server needed - everything runs on Internet Computer
4. **Enterprise Security**: Built-in verification and proof generation for all data

### **What We Deployed**
1. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Complete HTML interface with real-time contract monitoring
2. **Sample Data**: Aleo contract metrics, health status, and alert information
3. **Viewer Interface**: Interactive dashboard to access blockchain-stored data

### **Data Architecture**

TrustWrapper Business Value Demonstration

This demo proves TrustWrapper's real value proposition by catching actual business problems
that would cost enterprises significant money in regulatory fines, lawsuits, and liability.

Key Value Demonstrated:
- Financial advice violations (SEC violations, $500K+ fines)
- Medical advice liability (malpractice, $1M+ lawsuits)
- Legal advice violations (unauthorized practice, bar violations)
- PII exposure (GDPR €20M fines, CCPA $7,500 per record)
- Compliance violations (HIPAA $50K per incident)

This is the "AI Performance Insurance" MVP that justifies $25K-100K/year enterprise pricing.

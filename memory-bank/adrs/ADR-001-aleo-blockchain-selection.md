# ADR-001: Selection of Aleo Blockchain for Zero-Knowledge AI Verification

**Date**: June 21, 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Author**: Claude  
**Deciders**: Lamassu Labs Team

## Context

The TrustWrapper project requires a blockchain platform that can provide zero-knowledge proof capabilities for AI agent verification. We need to prove AI agent performance and execution metrics without revealing proprietary implementation details or sensitive data.

### Requirements
1. Native zero-knowledge proof support
2. Programmable smart contracts with privacy features
3. Reasonable transaction costs
4. Active developer ecosystem
5. Production readiness or clear path to mainnet
6. Good developer tooling and documentation

### Options Considered
1. **Aleo** - Purpose-built for ZK applications with Leo language
2. **Aztec** - Privacy-focused L2 on Ethereum
3. **Mina** - Succinct blockchain with ZK-SNARKs
4. **StarkNet** - ZK-rollup with Cairo language
5. **Polygon zkEVM** - EVM-compatible ZK-rollup

## Decision

We will use **Aleo** as the primary blockchain for TrustWrapper's zero-knowledge proof verification layer.

## Rationale

### Advantages of Aleo

1. **Native ZK Design**
   - Built from ground up for zero-knowledge applications
   - Leo language designed specifically for ZK circuits
   - Efficient proof generation and verification

2. **Privacy by Default**
   - Private inputs and computations are first-class citizens
   - Public/private data separation at language level
   - Record model preserves privacy

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Leo syntax similar to Rust/TypeScript
   - Good tooling with `leo` CLI
   - Clear documentation and examples

4. **Performance**
   - Optimized proof generation
   - Parallel transaction processing
   - Reasonable gas costs for ZK operations

5. **Ecosystem Alignment**
   - Focus on privacy-preserving applications
   - Growing developer community
   - Hackathon support and grants

### Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Aleo | Aztec | Mina | StarkNet | zkEVM |
|---------|------|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Native ZK | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ✅ Good | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Limited |
| Privacy Features | ✅ Native | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Basic | ⚠️ Basic | ❌ None |
| Developer Tools | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Early | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Good | ✅ Excellent |
| Production Ready | ⚠️ Testnet | ❌ Alpha | ✅ Mainnet | ✅ Mainnet | ✅ Mainnet |
| Learning Curve | ⚠️ New Lang | ⚠️ Complex | ⚠️ Complex | ⚠️ Cairo | ✅ Solidity |
| Gas Costs | ✅ Low | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ Low | ⚠️ Medium | ⚠️ High |

### Specific Benefits for TrustWrapper

1. **Agent Metrics Privacy**: Leo's private inputs perfectly match our need to hide performance metrics
2. **Proof Composition**: Can combine multiple proofs (performance + execution + quality)
3. **Efficient Verification**: On-chain verification is fast and cheap
4. **Future-Proof**: Aleo's roadmap aligns with our long-term vision

## Consequences

### Positive
- Strong privacy guarantees for AI agent implementations
- Efficient ZK proof generation and verification
- Clear separation of public and private data
- Growing ecosystem with potential partnerships
- First-mover advantage in ZK+AI space

### Negative
- Newer platform with less battle-testing
- Smaller developer community compared to EVM
- Need to learn Leo language
- Limited tooling compared to mature ecosystems
- Potential migration costs if platform fails

### Neutral
- Commitment to non-EVM ecosystem
- Need for specialized ZK knowledge
- Dependency on Aleo's success
- Different mental model (records vs accounts)

## Implementation Details

### Contract Architecture
```
agent_registry_v2.aleo
├── Private agent metrics
├── Public verification proofs
└── Staking mechanisms

trust_verifier_v2.aleo
├── Execution verification
├── Batch processing
└── Proof integrity
```

### Integration Points
1. Python SDK via `leo_integration.py`
2. REST API through Aleo RPC
3. Proof generation off-chain
4. Verification on-chain

## Alternatives Considered in Detail

### Aztec
- **Pros**: Ethereum ecosystem, strong privacy
- **Cons**: Very early stage, complex setup
- **Rejected because**: Not production-ready enough

### StarkNet
- **Pros**: Proven technology, good performance
- **Cons**: Less privacy focus, Cairo learning curve
- **Rejected because**: Privacy not first-class citizen

### Polygon zkEVM
- **Pros**: EVM compatibility, mature tooling
- **Cons**: No native privacy, higher costs
- **Rejected because**: Lacks privacy features we need

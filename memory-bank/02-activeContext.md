# Active Context - Lamassu Labs

**Last Updated**: June 21, 2025
**Current Focus**: Repository organization and structure setup

## 🎯 Current Task

Organizing the lamassu-labs repository according to Nuru AI enterprise standards for better maintainability and hackathon development.

## 📋 Recently Completed

1. ✅ Copied AI agent research and implementation files
2. ✅ Resolved agent dependencies 
3. ✅ Created initial repository structure
4. ✅ Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/eladmint/lamassu-labs
5. ✅ Reorganized according to enterprise standards

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Create Leo smart contracts directory structure
2. Set up TypeScript/JavaScript SDK scaffolding
3. Design marketplace UI mockups
4. Write initial Leo contract for agent verification

## 💡 Key Insights

- Following Nuru AI project structure standards ensures consistency
- Proper organization critical for 48-hour hackathon efficiency
- Agent implementations provide foundation for ZK verification demos

## 🔧 Technical Context

- **Framework**: Extending Agent Forge with ZK proofs
- **Blockchain**: Aleo with Leo programming language
- **Architecture**: Privacy-preserving agent verification
- **Target**: $10,000 Aleo prize pool

## 📝 Notes

The repository now follows enterprise standards with proper separation of:
- Source code in `src/`
- Documentation in `docs/`
- Knowledge management in `memory-bank/`
- Tests in `tests/`
- Examples in `examples/`

This structure will support rapid hackathon development while maintaining code quality.

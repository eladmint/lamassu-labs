# ✅ Demo Cleanup Complete!

## Before: 18 files (confusing)
## After: 7 essential files (organized)

### New Structure:
```
demo/
├── presentations/          # 🎯 3 main demos for different audiences
│   ├── hackathon_demo.py      # Gaming-style main presentation
│   ├── simple_story_demo.py   # Non-technical story version
│   └── visual_architecture.py # Technical deep-dive
│
├── examples/              # 📦 3 agent examples + runner
│   ├── event_wrapper.py       # Event discovery agent
│   ├── scraper_wrapper.py     # Web scraping agent  
│   ├── treasury_wrapper.py    # Treasury monitoring agent
│   └── run_all_examples.py    # Runs all 3 examples
│
├── archive/               # 📁 10 redundant demos (archived)
│   └── [10 old demo files]
│
└── README.md             # 📚 Clear instructions

```

## Benefits:
1. **Clear Purpose**: Each demo has a specific audience/purpose
2. **No Confusion**: Obvious which demo to run when
3. **Clean Structure**: Logical organization
4. **Easy Navigation**: Find what you need quickly

## Quick Commands:

```bash
# For hackathon presentation
python presentations/hackathon_demo.py

# To show it working with 3 different agents
python examples/run_all_examples.py

# For technical deep-dive
python presentations/visual_architecture_demo.py

# For non-technical explanation
python presentations/simple_story_demo.py
```

## Archived Files:
All 10 redundant demos have been safely moved to `archive/` directory in case they're needed later.

The demo suite is now clean, focused, and ready for the hackathon! 🚀

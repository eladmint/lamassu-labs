# üõ°Ô∏è TrustWrapper Demos

## Three Essential Demos

### 1. üèÜ **Hackathon Presentation** (10-15 minutes)
Complete presentation for judges covering all aspects of TrustWrapper.

```bash
python demo/hackathon_presentation.py
```

**Covers:**
- The three trust problems (performance, explainability, quality)
- Our three-layer solution architecture
- Live XAI demonstrations with feature importance
- Quality consensus with validator results
- Complete integration showing all layers working together
- Market impact and use cases
- Why we win (technical innovation + real market need)

### 2. ‚ö° **Technical Demo** (3-5 minutes)
Quick technical validation showing the progression from basic agent to fully trusted.

```bash
python demo/technical_demo.py
```

**Shows:**
- Step 1: Basic agent (no trust)
- Step 2: + Performance verification (ZK proofs)
- Step 3: + Explainable AI (decision transparency)
- Step 4: + Quality consensus (independent validation)
- Complete trust transformation summary

### 3. üìñ **Usage Example** (1-2 minutes)
Simple code examples showing how developers can integrate TrustWrapper.

```bash
python demo/usage_example.py
```

**Demonstrates:**
- Basic TrustWrapper usage (3 lines of code)
- Adding explainable AI
- Complete trust infrastructure
- Integration patterns
- Production deployment tips

## Which Demo to Use?

- **For Hackathon Judges**: `hackathon_presentation.py` (comprehensive)
- **For Technical Validation**: `technical_demo.py` (quick proof)
- **For Developers**: `usage_example.py` (how to integrate)

## Key Message

**TrustWrapper is the first comprehensive trust infrastructure for AI agents**, solving all three trust problems:

1. **Performance Trust** ‚Üí ZK proofs on Aleo
2. **Explainability Trust** ‚Üí Ziggurat XAI integration  
3. **Quality Trust** ‚Üí Agent Forge consensus validation

Universal wrapper that works with ANY existing agent - no code changes needed!

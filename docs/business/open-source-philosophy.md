# TrustWrapper Open Core Philosophy

## Balancing Innovation, Trust, and Sustainability

At Lamassu Labs, we believe in the power of open source to drive adoption and build trust, while protecting the intellectual property that enables sustainable innovation. Our **Open Core** model provides the best of both worlds.

## 🌍 Our Core Beliefs

### 1. Essential Infrastructure Should Be Open
Like internet protocols (HTTP, TCP/IP), basic AI verification infrastructure should be freely accessible. Everyone deserves access to fundamental trust tools.

### 2. Innovation Requires Investment Protection
Advanced AI verification algorithms represent years of research and development. Protecting this intellectual property ensures continued innovation and improvement.

### 3. Transparency Builds Trust
Our open source framework allows complete inspection of basic verification logic, ensuring no hidden biases in fundamental operations. Advanced algorithms are protected but auditable through enterprise partnerships.

## 💡 Open Core Business Model

Our sustainable approach combines open source adoption with protected innovation:

### Free Tier (Open Source Framework)
Basic verification framework with simple pattern matching, integration libraries, and documentation. Perfect for developers getting started and building community trust.

### Professional Tier ($299-999/month)
API access to advanced ML-powered verification algorithms, real-time monitoring, and enterprise integration support. Protects our IP while providing value.

### Enterprise Tier ($25K+/year)
Licensed deployment of proprietary algorithms, custom model training, and partnership-specific features. Enables high-value partnerships while maintaining competitive advantage.

## 🛠️ What's Open vs Protected

### Forever Open Source:
- ✅ Basic verification framework and interfaces
- ✅ Simple pattern matching (obvious scams only)
- ✅ Integration SDKs and documentation
- ✅ Smart contract infrastructure
- ✅ Testing frameworks and examples

### Proprietary (IP Protected):
- 🔒 **Advanced ML algorithms** - Our competitive moat
- 🔒 **Oracle manipulation detection** - High-value partnership features
- 🔒 **Enterprise compliance engines** - Regulatory automation
- 🔒 **Performance optimization techniques** - Technical advantages
- 🔒 **Custom model training** - Client-specific intelligence

## 🤝 Our Promise to the Community

1. **Smart contracts will always be free** - No fees, no licenses, no restrictions
2. **Core algorithms remain open** - You can always verify how trust scores are calculated
3. **No vendor lock-in** - You can always run your own infrastructure
4. **Community first** - Major decisions involve community input
5. **Sustainable development** - Premium services fund ongoing improvements

## 📖 Learning from History

We're inspired by successful open source projects that built sustainable businesses:

- **GitLab** - Open source core, paid enterprise features
- **Elastic** - Free search, paid monitoring and security
- **MongoDB** - Open database, paid cloud services
- **Redis** - Free data store, paid enterprise modules

These projects proved you can be both open source and commercially successful.

## 🚀 The Future

As AI becomes more prevalent, the need for trustworthy AI will only grow. By keeping our core technology open and free, we ensure that:

1. **Small developers** can build trustworthy AI applications
2. **Researchers** can advance the field of AI verification
3. **Enterprises** can rely on battle-tested, transparent technology
4. **Society** benefits from more trustworthy AI systems

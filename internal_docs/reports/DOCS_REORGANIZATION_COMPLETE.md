# Documentation Reorganization Complete

**Date**: June 22, 2025 (2:50 AM)  
**Task**: Organize docs directory following onboarding standards

## 📊 Summary

Successfully reorganized the documentation to follow our onboarding standards with clear separation between public documentation and internal reports.

## 📁 New Organization

### Public Documentation (`docs/`)
Now organized by user journey and purpose:

```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Documentation hub with clear navigation
├── getting-started/            # Onboarding guides (2-minute success)
├── technical/                  # Deep technical documentation
├── deployment/                 # Aleo deployment guides
├── architecture/               # Architecture decisions and ADRs
├── guides/                     # How-to guides
└── hackathon/                  # Hackathon-specific materials
```

### Internal Documentation (`internal_docs/`)
Properly separated internal content:

```
internal_docs/
├── reports/
│   ├── deployment/            # Deployment completion reports
│   └── PROJECT_ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md
├── archive/
│   ├── deployment/            # Archived deployment docs
│   └── project-management/    # Project management docs
└── research/                  # Market research (moved from public)
```

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Created New Structure
- `docs/deployment/` - All deployment guides with README
- `internal_docs/reports/deployment/` - Deployment completion reports
- `internal_docs/archive/project-management/` - Internal planning docs

### 2. Moved Documents
**To internal_docs/reports/deployment/**:
- ALEO_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md
- ALEO_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md 
- DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md
- DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md
- ALEO_SECURITY_AUDIT.md

**To docs/deployment/**:
- ALEO_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (public guide)
- LEO_ALEO_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- DEPLOYMENT_COMMANDS.md
- TESTING_DEPLOYED_CONTRACTS.md
- ALEO_SYNTAX_NOTES.md

**To internal_docs/**:
- research/ directory (market research is internal)
- PROJECT_ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md
- DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md
- IMMEDIATE_DOC_UPDATES.md

### 3. Created Navigation
- Added deployment/README.md for easy navigation

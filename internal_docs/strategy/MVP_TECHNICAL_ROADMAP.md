# 🚀 MVP Technical Roadmap - Lamassu Labs

**Goal**: Ship working DeFi-focused MVP in 8 hours
**Target Prize**: Aleo DeFi Track ($5,000)

## 📦 MVP Core Features (8 hours)

### 1. Smart Contract (2 hours)
**File**: `src/zk/contracts/agent_registry.leo`
- [x] Agent registration with private metrics
- [x] Performance verification without revealing data
- [x] Stake management system
- [ ] Deploy to Aleo testnet

### 2. Proof Generation SDK (2 hours)
**File**: `src/zk/sdk/proof-generator.ts`
```typescript
// Core functions needed:
- generateAgentMetrics(agent: Agent): AgentMetrics
- createRegistrationProof(metrics: AgentMetrics): Proof
- verifyPerformance(agentId: string, metrics: AgentMetrics): VerificationResult
```

### 3. Basic UI (3 hours)
**Files**: `src/marketplace/ui/`
- [ ] Landing page with value proposition
- [ ] Agent registration form
- [ ] Staking interface
- [ ] Verification badge display
- [ ] Wallet connection (Leo Wallet)

### 4. Demo & Documentation (1 hour)
- [ ] Deploy contracts to testnet
- [ ] Record video walkthrough
- [ ] Update README with setup instructions
- [ ] Submit to Aleo DeFi track

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Required Tools
- **Aleo SDK**: For Leo development
- **snarkVM**: For proof generation
- **React**: Simple UI framework
- **Leo Wallet**: For testnet interaction

### MVP Architecture
```
User → React UI → Leo Wallet → Aleo Testnet
         ↓
   Proof Generator
         ↓
   Agent Metrics
```

## 📊 MVP User Flow

1. **Connect Wallet** → Leo Wallet connection
2. **Register Agent** → Submit metrics + stake
3. **Generate Proof** → Private verification
4. **Receive Badge** → On-chain verification record
5. **View Dashboard** → See staked agents

## 🎯 Value Proposition

**For Aleo DeFi Track**:
- **DeFi Mechanism**: Stake tokens on agent performance
- **Privacy Feature**: Agents keep algorithms secret
- **Economic Model**: Higher performance = Higher rewards
- **Use Case**: AI agent reputation market

## ⚡ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install Leo
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AleoHQ/leo/main/install.sh | sh

# Create new Aleo project
leo new agent_registry
cd agent_registry

# Copy our contract
cp ../src/zk/contracts/agent_registry.leo src/main.leo

# Build contract
leo build

# Deploy to testnet
leo deploy --network testnet
```

## 📱 Minimal UI Components

### 1. Hero Section
```
"Stake on AI Excellence"
Privacy-preserving AI agent verification on Aleo
[Connect Wallet] [View Agents]
```

### 2. Register Agent Form
```
Agent Name: [___________]
Your Metrics (Private):
- Accuracy: [slider 0-100]
- Latency: [input ms]
- Tasks Completed: [number]
- Success Rate: [slider 0-100]

Stake Amount: [___] Aleo Credits
[Generate Proof & Register]
```

### 3. Agent Card
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 🤖 Agent Name          │
│ ⭐ Verified             │
│ 💰 Staked: 1000 ALEO   │
│ 📊 Performance: 85/100  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Checklist

### Must Have for Submission
- [ ] Leo contract compiles
- [ ] Contract deployed to testnet
- [ ] Basic UI works
- [ ] Can register at least 1 agent
- [ ] Video shows the flow
- [ ] GitHub repo is public
- [ ] README has clear instructions

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Multiple agents registered
- [ ] Staking rewards calculation
- [ ] Leaderboard
- [ ] Better UI design

## 💡 Key Differentiators

1. **First ZK Agent Marketplace**: Novel use case
2. **Real Privacy Need**: Agents need algorithm secrecy
3. **Clear DeFi Mechanism**: Stake on performance
4. **Working Demo**: Not just concept

## 🎬 Video Script (2 minutes)

1. **Problem** (20s): "AI agents need to prove capabilities without revealing code"
2. **Solution** (30s): "Lamassu Labs - ZK proofs for agent verification"
3. **Demo** (60s): Show registration flow end-to-end
4. **Impact** (10s): "Enabling trustless AI agent economy"

## 🏃 Sprint Plan

### Hour 1-2: Smart Contract
- Set up Leo environment
- Write agent_registry.leo
- Test locally

### Hour 3-4: Proof Generation
- Create TypeScript SDK
- Mock agent metrics
- Test proof generation

### Hour 5-7: UI Development
- React setup
- Basic components
- Wallet integration

### Hour 8: Polish & Submit
- Deploy to testnet
- Record video
- Submit to Devfolio

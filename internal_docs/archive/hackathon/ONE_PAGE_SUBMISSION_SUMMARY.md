# TrustWrapper by Lamassu Labs - ZK Berlin Hackathon

## 🎯 The Problem
AI agents are powerful but untrustworthy black boxes. You can't verify their performance claims, understand their decisions, or confirm output quality.

## 💡 Our Solution  
**TrustWrapper** - The first comprehensive trust infrastructure for AI agents combining:
- **ZK Performance Verification** (Aleo blockchain)
- **Explainable AI** (Ziggurat Intelligence)
- **Quality Consensus** (Agent Forge validators)

## 🚀 Live on Aleo Testnet!

### Deployed Contracts
```
agent_registry_simple.aleo  - AI agent verification
trust_verifier_test.aleo   - Execution verification
```

### Key Innovation
```python
# Transform ANY agent into trusted system
agent = YourExistingAgent()
trusted_agent = TrustWrapper(agent)
result = trusted_agent.verified_execute()

# Result includes:
# ✓ ZK performance proof
# ✓ Decision explanations  
# ✓ Quality consensus (96%)
```

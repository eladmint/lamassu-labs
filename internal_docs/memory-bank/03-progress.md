## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **TrustWrapper Core**: Universal wrapper working with ANY AI agent
2. **First ZK + XAI**: Successfully integrated explainable AI with ZK proofs
3. **DEPLOYED ON ALEO**: Two contracts live on testnet! First ZK-AI system on Aleo
4. **Three-Layer Trust**: Performance + Explainability + Quality consensus
5. **Comprehensive Demos**: Full suite of interactive and auto-running demos
6. **70%+ Test Coverage**: Production-ready code quality
7. **Clear Value Prop**: Complete trust infrastructure for AI agents
8. **12.1 Credits Deployed**: Efficient contract implementation

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Wrapper Pattern Power**: Universal wrapper approach allows ANY agent integration
2. **XAI Differentiator**: Explainability is key differentiator from basic verification
3. **Demo Organization**: Separating presentations/ and examples/ improves clarity
4. **Auto Demos**: Non-interactive demos essential for booth displays
5. **Integration Story**: Clear progression (Performance → Explainability → Quality) resonates

## 🚀 Final Steps

**Remaining Tasks**:
1. Record video demonstration of deployed contracts
2. Submit final materials to hackathon
3. Prepare for judge presentations

**Documentation Updates Completed**:

**Current Focus**: Modular MVP strategy for maximum prize potential

## 🎯 Current Task

Developing modular strategy to target multiple hackathon prizes, starting with focused MVP for Aleo DeFi track.

## 📋 Recently Completed

1. ✅ Repository reorganization following enterprise standards
2. ✅ Corrected Aleo prize structure understanding (2x $5k, not 1x $10k)
3. ✅ Created modular development strategy targeting $8k+ realistic prizes
4. ✅ Drafted initial Leo smart contract for agent registry
5. ✅ Defined clear MVP technical roadmap (8-hour plan)

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### MVP Development (8 hours)
1. Set up Leo development environment
2. Deploy agent_registry.leo to testnet
3. Build proof generation SDK (TypeScript)
4. Create minimal React UI with wallet connection
5. Record demo video

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### Prize Strategy
- **MVP Target**: Aleo DeFi ($5,000) - achievable in 8 hours
- **Realistic Additional**: ZKPassport ($1,500), Boundless ($1,500)
- **Total Realistic**: $8,000 with modular approach
- **Stretch Goal**: Add gaming module for Aleo Gaming ($5,000)

### Technical Approach
- **Core Innovation**: ZK proofs for AI agent performance verification
- **DeFi Mechanism**: Stake on agent performance metrics
- **Privacy Value**: Agents prove capabilities without revealing code
- **Modular Design**: Each feature is a separate module

## 🔧 Technical Context

- **Smart Contract**: `agent_registry.leo` ready for deployment
- **Architecture**: Private metrics → ZK proof → Public verification → Staking
- **Stack**: Leo + React + TypeScript + Aleo Testnet
- **Time Budget**: 48 hours total, 8 hours for MVP

## 📝 Key Decisions

1. **MVP First**: Focus on working Aleo DeFi submission before expanding
2. **Modular Architecture**: Each prize target is a separate module
3. **Multiple Submissions**: Same core, different positioning per track
4. **Time Boxing**: Strict 8-hour limit for MVP to leave room for expansion

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- [ ] Leo contract deployed to testnet
- [ ] At least 1 agent registered with ZK proof
- [ ] Basic UI with wallet connection
- [ ] 2-minute demo video
- [ ] Submitted to Aleo DeFi track

**Motto**: "Ship first, perfect later!"

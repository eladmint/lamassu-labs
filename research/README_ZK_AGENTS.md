### The Core Problem
Professionals and companies lose billions because they can't share information without revealing secrets:
- People accept 20% less salary due to information asymmetry
- Companies duplicate 60% of R&D due to inability to share failures
- $50B of expertise locked behind employment contracts

### The ZK Solution
Build tools where privacy ENABLES collaboration rather than preventing it:
- More users = more value AND more privacy (network effects)
- Cryptographic verification without identity revelation
- Immediate value delivery with clear revenue models

### Implementation Priority
1. **PayRadar** - Easiest path to product-market fit
2. **GhostConsult** - Highest revenue per user
3. **CompetitorWatch** - Enterprise network effects

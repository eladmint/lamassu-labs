```python
from langchain.callbacks.base import BaseCallbackHandler
from langchain.schema import LLMResult, AgentAction
import logging

class ZKVerificationCallback(BaseCallbackHandler):
    """Callback handler for ZK-verified auditing in LangChain."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger("ZKVerification")
        self.logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
        handler = logging.FileHandler("zk_verification_audit.log")
        self.logger.addHandler(handler)
    
    def on_llm_end(self, output: LLMResult, **kwargs) -> None:
        """Log and verify LLM output using ZK proof."""
        response = output.generations[0][0].text
        if self._zk_verify_response(response):
            self.logger.info(f"ZK-Verified LLM Response: {response}")
        else:
            self.logger.warning(f"ZK Verification Failed for Response: {response}")
    
    def on_agent_action(self, action: AgentAction, **kwargs) -> None:
        """Log and verify agent tool selection using ZK proof."""
        tool = action.tool
        self.logger.info(f"Agent Action Audit: Tool selected - {tool}")
        if not self._zk_verify_tool(tool):
            self.logger.warning(f"ZK Verification Failed for Tool: {tool}")
    
    def _zk_verify_response(self, response: str) -> bool:
        """Placeholder for ZK proof verification of response."""
        # Simulate ZK proof verification (e.g., check response integrity)
        return len(response) > 0 and "error" not in response.lower()
    
    def _zk_verify_tool(self, tool: str) -> bool:
        """Placeholder for ZK proof verification of tool selection."""
        allowed_tools = ["search", "calculator", "database_query"]

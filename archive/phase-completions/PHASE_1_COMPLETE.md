## 🚀 What We Built (In Simple Terms)

**Think of TrustWrapper as a universal translator and security guard for blockchain AI.**

Before TrustWrapper, each blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) had its own security system - like different countries with different languages and security protocols. If you wanted to verify AI decisions across multiple blockchains, you needed separate systems for each one.

**Now with TrustWrapper v3.0:**
- ✅ **One system works with ALL major blockchains** (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cardano, Solana, Polygon)
- ✅ **AI decisions are verified instantly** across multiple networks
- ✅ **Enterprise-grade security** protects against fraud and errors
- ✅ **Handles 20,000+ requests per second** - ready for massive scale

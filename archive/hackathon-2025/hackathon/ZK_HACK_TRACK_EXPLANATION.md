- Creates a new category: **Privacy-Preserving AI Infrastructure**

### 2. **Advanced ZK Techniques Implementation**
- **Recursive proof composition** for multi-layer verification
- **Proof aggregation** across multiple AI agent validators
- **On-chain verification** with minimal gas costs on Aleo
- **13.99x performance optimization** making ZK proofs practical for real-time AI

### 3. **Educational Impact for ZK Community**
- **Open-source Leo contracts** teaching ZK-AI integration patterns
- **Comprehensive documentation** explaining ZK concepts in AI context
- **Working examples** that developers can learn from and build upon
- **Bridge between AI and ZK communities** - bringing new developers to ZK

## üí° Solving the "Chewing Glass" Problem

TrustWrapper tackles one of the **hardest problems in the ZK space**:

### The Challenge:
"How do you verify complex AI model behavior without exposing the model itself?"

### Our Solution:
- **Zero-knowledge performance proofs** that hide implementation details
- **Explainable AI layer** that provides transparency without compromise
- **Quality consensus** through decentralized validation
- **Real-world deployment** on Aleo testnet proving feasibility

## üåç Ecosystem Advancement
